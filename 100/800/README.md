# 800 - Database interaction with Prisma

Alright my friends. Let's talk about Prisma. I am not a database person... At all. All the backend stuff is outside of my wheelhouse. What's funny though is Remix makes the backend so approachable that most of the work I've been doing over the past few months has been backend stuff ðŸ˜† And I couldn't be happier with how simple Prisma makes working with a database. Not just querying Postgres, but also data migrations. It's truly amazing how approachable Prisma makes it. So let's talk about those things.
