# 900 - Conclusion

I can't tell you how much I've learned from building this website. It's been a ton of fun and I'm excited to put my learnings into blog posts and workshops to teach you the specifics of how I did this stuff so you can do it too. In fact, I've already scheduled some workshops for you to attend! [Pick up tickets now](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops). I look forward to seeing you there! Take care, and keep up the good work.

And don't forget, if you haven't already read the ["Introducing the new kentcdodds.com"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/introducing-the-new-kentcdodds.com) post, please do give it a read!
